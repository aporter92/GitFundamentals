# git config
When first setting up git you'll need to work with git config commands in order to set up your identity.
For example, your identity can be set with the commands such as:
```
git config -- global user.name "Anne Porter"
git config -- global user.email a.porter9212@gmail.com
```
For more information, view the [First time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
